# Scalable-ETL-Pipeline-for-Spotify-Analytics-on-AWS
## Overview

Welcome to the Scalable ETL Pipeline for Spotify Analytics on AWS! This project is all about building a robust pipeline to process and analyze Spotify data efficiently. By leveraging various AWS services, we can handle large volumes of data, providing valuable insights into music trends and artist popularity.

## Technologies Used
- AWS S3: Storage for both raw and processed data.
- Apache Kafka: Manages real-time data that feeds into the pipeline.
- AWS Glue: Automates the ETL process, transforming raw data into a structured format ready for analysis.
- AWS Athena: Enables data analysis by querying processed data stored in S3.
- Python: For data processing and interacting with AWS services.

## Pipeline Stages
1. Data Ingestion: Spotify data in CSV format is initially stored in AWS S3, with Kafka handling data streaming.
2. Data Processing: Use AWS Glue to transform raw data into a cleaned and structured format.
  - Various data tables including tracks, albums, and artists are joined to create comprehensive views, enabling complex analytical queries.
3. Data Storage: Store the cleaned data back in S3 in an optimized format for querying.
4. Data Analysis: Use AWS Athena to run queries on the structured data and derive insights.

## How to Use
- Set Up AWS Services: Ensure you have AWS S3, Kafka, Glue, and Athena configured.
- Deploy Python Scripts: Use the provided scripts for data ingestion and processing.
- Configure AWS Glue: Set up the ETL jobs.
- Run Queries with Athena: Analyze the processed data to gain insights.
